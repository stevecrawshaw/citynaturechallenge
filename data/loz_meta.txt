I’ve downloaded all the data – so you should be able to access all the West of England City Nature Challenge 2018-2024 data here

 

Would it be possible to know:

What percentage of the records have an open licence (CC0 or CC-BY) this year? And how did that compare to previous years?
And the same but with “casual” records taken out equation (As these aren’t used outside inaturalist anyway)
Would it be possible to know the percentage of participants are using open records (CC0 or CC-BY)? (slightly different to the percentage of records that have open licences)
 

It would be great to have graphs to show the number of unique participants that have taken part in the years 2018- 2024   - to show the increase/decrease in number of people taking part
Same for number of total observations
 

There isn’t anything else I can think of that we need- but when you look at the data if there’s anything that seems interesting please do share with us! Or if this isn’t the sort of questions the data portal is for, let me know what else we can do with the data 😊
